# Random Desktop Background for Mac
Silly prank you can play on friends to make their desktop backgrounds constantly changing.

_Only tested on Python 2.7 on macOS Mojave_

## Usage:
Change background every 30 (default) seconds:
```bash
python m.py
```

Change background every 10 seconds:
```bash
python m.y 10
```

Definitely the most fun to run as `screen` in the background, especially with an extra long period specified:
```bash
screen python m.py 300
```
